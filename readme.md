= Goal = 

Learn how to use the ES6 class construct.

= Setup =

As your browser probably does not yet support ES6, Babel is used to transpile ES6 code to ES5.

= Tasks =

# Change the type of your script from "text/javascript" to "text/babel" to start working with ES6 (described on https://babeljs.io/docs/usage/browser/)
# Refactor the application logic to use the class construct

= Solution = 

The solution includes a main Application class (App), three business classes (Car, Motor, Light) and a helper class (Logger).
